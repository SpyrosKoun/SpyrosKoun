My name is ***Spyros Kounoupidis*** and I live in Thessaloniki, Greece. I am currently an **undergraduate** in the **Computer Science Department** of **Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTh)**.

I'm currently trying to find out what I like the most from the Computer Science subfields.

At the moment, my favourite ones are Software Engineering and Algorithm Design

During my free time, I like watching Netflix and trying to get better on what I like. That is **Computer Science**
